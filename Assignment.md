Objectives:
- how much does dataset effect prediction performance. Can wildfires detection from Greece be generalized to other countries
- Data availability 
- what modelling techniques offer best results
	- DL vs ML vs image processing
	- segmentation vs object detection
	- segmentation PLUS object detection 
		- score development (IOU, F1)
	- accuracy vs compute
Question:
- Do the algorithms need to be written from scratch or may we use packages?
- What algorithms are permitted? Can we use DL?

Dataset:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmadafri/the-wildfire-dataset - Range of resolutions
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset - Low Res ~42k images
- https://zenodo.org/records/6475592 - Example from notebook
