1.) Ensure that folders containing fire/nofire training frames
are in the correct folder, or alternatively ensure that the pre-trained
SVM is in the same folder as the python script.

2.) Ensure that the video to run detection on is in the same folder as the python 
script, and that the name is inserted into the python file.

3.) Run the code. This should either train the SVM if required, or just reuse the
pre-trained SVM. 

4.) A window should appear, showing the input video with any fire candidate regions
clearly marked using a bounding box.

5.) As this window is playing, the system is working out the wavelet energy and using them
to make predictions. Please be patient.

6.) When the algorithm finishes running, a series of graphs will be output. One graph will
show the wavelet energy of the frames. The other graph will show the classification of predictions
for the frames. Ideally, the graph should all read zero; it will read one if a fire has been detected,
which indicates that the alarm should be raised.
