## Description
Repository for group project in real-time wildfire detection for the EE581 module at the University of Strathclyde, developed by Group 8 (Joseph Kromer, Sai Tam, Mukul Narwani and Michail Kasmeridis). 
The project is split into 2 parts - two subgroups - developing an algorithm each, capable of detecting wildfires in real-time.
  - The first group, comprising of Sai Tam and Mukul Narwani, are developing an algorithm that utilises the help of Artificial Intelligence.
  - The second group, comprising of Joseph Kromer and Michail Kasmeridis, are developing an algorithm that uses a kernel to detect orange, black or white colors in an image section.
  - The two approaches will be compared using `metrics`.

The current progress of the group is tracked using a [Gannt Chart](https://github.com/itsm1kekay/wildfire-detection/edit/main/README.md#gantt-chart).
